'''
SPADE is the combination of a mining technique and multiple statistical tests
to detect and assess the statistical significance of repeated occurrences of
spike sequences (spatio-temporal patterns, STP).

Given a list of Neo Spiketrain objects, assumed to be recorded in parallel, the
SPADE analysis can be applied as demonstrated in this short toy example of 10
artificial spike trains of exhibiting fully synchronous events of order 10.

This modules relies on the implementation of the fp-growth algorithm contained
in the file fim.so which can be found here (http://www.borgelt.net/pyfim.html)
and should be available in the spade_src folder (elephant/spade_src/).
If the fim.so module is not present in the correct location or cannot be
imported (only available for linux OS) SPADE will make use of a python
implementation of the fast fca algorithm contained in
elephant/spade_src/fast_fca.py, which is about 10 times slower.

    """
    Perform the SPADE [1,2] analysis for the parallel spike trains given in the
    input. The data are discretized with a temporal resolution equal binsize
    in a sliding window of winlen*binsize milliseconds.

    First, spike patterns are mined from the data using a technique termed
    frequent itemset mining (FIM) or formal concept analysis (FCA). In this
    framework, a particular spatio-temporal spike pattern is termed a
    "concept". It is then possible to compute the stability and the signature
    significance of all pattern candidates. In a final step, it is possible to
    select a stability threshold and the significance level to select only
    stable/significant concepts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: list of neo.SpikeTrains
        List containing the parallel spike trains to analyze
    binsize: Quantity
        The time precision used to discretize the data (binning).
    winlen: int (positive)
        The size (number of bins) of the sliding window used for the analysis.
        The maximal length of a pattern (delay between first and last spike) is
        then given by winlen*binsize
    min_spikes: int (positive)
        Minimum number of spikes of a sequence to be considered a pattern.
        Default: 2
    min_occ: int (positive)
        Minimum number of occurrences of a sequence to be considered as a
        pattern.
        Default: 2
    max_spikes: int (positive)
        Maximum number of spikes of a sequence to be considered a pattern. If
        None no maximal number of spikes is considered.
        Default: None
    max_occ: int (positive)
        Maximum number of occurrences of a sequence to be considered as a
        pattern. If None, no maximal number of occurrences is considered.
        Default: None
    min_neu: int (positive)
        Minimum number of neurons in a sequence to considered a pattern.
        Default: 1
    n_subsets: int
        Number of subsets of a concept used to approximate its stability. If
        n_subset is set to 0 the stability is not computed. If, however,
        for parameters delta and epsilon (see below) delta + epsilon == 0,
        then an optimal n_subsets is calculated according to the formula given
        in Babin, Kuznetsov (2012), proposition 6:

         ..math::
                n_subset = frac{1}{2\eps^2} \ln(frac{2}{\delta}) +1

        Default:0
    delta: float
        delta: probability with at least ..math:$1-\delta$
        Default: 0
    epsilon: float
        epsilon: absolute error
        Default: 0
    stability_thresh: None or list of float
        List containing the stability thresholds used to filter the concepts.
        If stab_thr is None, then the concepts are not filtered. Otherwise,
        only concepts with intensional stability > stab_thr[0] or extensional
        stability > stab_thr[1] are returned and used for further analysis
        within SPADE.
        Default: None
    n_surr: int
        Number of surrogates to generate to compute the p-value spectrum.
        This number should be large (n_surr>=1000 is recommended for 100
        spike trains in *sts*). If n_surr is 0, then the p-value spectrum is
        not computed.
        Default: 0
    dither: Quantity
        Amount of spike time dithering for creating the surrogates for
        filtering the pattern spectrum. A spike at time t is placed randomly
        within ]t-dither, t+dither[ (see also
        elephant.spike_train_surrogates.dither_spikes).
        Default: 15*pq.s
    spectrum: str
        Define the signature of the patterns, it can assume values:
        '#': pattern spectrum using the as signature the pair:
            (number of spikes, number of occurrences)
        '3d#': pattern spectrum using the as signature the triplets:
            (number of spikes, number of occurrence, difference between last
            and first spike of the pattern)
        Default: '#'
    alpha: float
        The significance level of the hypothesis tests performed. If alpha=1
        all the concepts are returned. If 0<alpha<1 the concepts
        are filtered according to their signature in the p-value spectrum.
        Default: 1
    stat_corr: str
        Statistical correction to be applied:
            '' : no statistical correction
            'f', 'fdr' : false discovery rate
            'b', 'bonf': Bonferroni correction
         Default: 'fdr'
    psr_param: None or list of int
        This list contains parameters used in the pattern spectrum filtering:
            psr_param[0]: correction parameter for subset filtering
                (see parameter h of psr()).
            psr_param[1]: correction parameter for superset filtering
                (see parameter k of psr()).
            psr_param[2]: correction parameter for covered-spikes criterion

        'concepts' and 'patterns'.

    Returns
    -------
    The output depends on the value of the parameter output_format.

    If output_format is 'concepts':
        output: dict
            Dictionary containing the following keys:
            patterns: tuple
                Each element of the tuple corresponds to a pattern and is
                itself a tuple consisting of:
                    (spikes in the pattern, occurrences of the patterns)
                For details see function concepts_mining().

                If n_subsets>0:
                    (spikes in the pattern, occurrences of the patterns,
                    (intensional stability, extensional stability))
                    corresponding pvalue

            The patterns are filtered depending on the parameters in input:
            If stability_thresh==None and alpha==1:
                output['patterns'] contains all the candidates patterns
                (all concepts mined with the fca algorithm)
            If stability_thresh!=None and alpha==1:
                output contains only patterns candidates with:
                    intensional stability>stability_thresh[0] or
                    extensional stability>stability_thresh[1]
            If stability_thresh==None and alpha!=1:
                output contains only pattern candidates with a signature
                significant in respect the significance level alpha corrected
            If stability_thresh!=None and alpha!=1:
                output['patterns'] contains only pattern candidates with a
                signature significant in respect the significance level alpha
                corrected and such that:
                    intensional stability>stability_thresh[0] or
                    extensional stability>stability_thresh[1]
                In addition, output['non_sgnf_sgnt'] contains the list of
                non-significant signature for the significance level alpha.
            If n_surr>0:
                output['pvalue_spectrum'] contains a tuple of signatures and
                the corresponding p-value.

    If output_format is 'patterns':
        output: list
            List of dictionaries. Each dictionary corresponds to a patterns and
            has the following keys:
                neurons: array containing the indices of the neurons of the
                    pattern.
                lags: array containing the lags (integers corresponding to the
                    number of bins) between the spikes of the patterns. The
                    first lag is always assumed to be 0 and correspond to the
                    first spike ['times'] array containing the times.
            (integers corresponding to the bin idx) of the occurrences of the
            patterns
                signature: tuple containing two integers:
                    (number of spikes of the patterns,
                    number of occurrences of the pattern)
            pvalue: the p-value corresponding to the pattern. If n_surr==0 the
                p-values are set to 0.0.

    Notes
    -----
    If detected, this function will utilize MPI to parallelize the analysis.

    Example
    -------
    The following applies SPADE to a list of spike trains in data. These calls
    do not include the statistical testing (for details see the documentation
    of spade.spade())

    >>> import elephant.spade
    >>> import quantities as pq
    >>> binsize = 3 * pq.ms # time resolution used to discretize the data
    >>> winlen = 10 # maximal pattern length in bins (i.e., sliding window)
    >>> result_spade = spade.spade(data, binsize, winlen)

    mining_results: list
        If report == 'a':
            All the pattern candidates (concepts) found in the data. Each
            pattern is represented as a tuple containing
            (spike IDs, discrete times (window position)
            of the  occurrences of the pattern). The spike IDs are defined as:

        A binary matrix with shape (number of windows, winlen*len(data)). Each
        row corresponds to a window (order according to their position in
        time). Each column correspond to one bin and one neuron and it is 0 if
        no spikes or 1 if one or more spikes occurred in that bin for that
        particular neuron. For example, the entry [0,0] of this matrix
        corresponds to the first bin of the first window position for the first
        neuron, the entry [0,winlen] to the first bin of the first window
        position for the second neuron.

        The time precision used to discretize the data (binning).
    winlen: int (positive)
        The size (number of bins) of the sliding window used for the analysis.
        The maximal length of a pattern (delay between first and last spike) is
        then given by winlen*binsize
    dither: Quantity
        Amount of spike time dithering for creating the surrogates for
        filtering the pattern spectrum. A spike at time t is placed randomly
        within ]t-dither, t+dither[ (see also

        Default: 15*pq.s
    n_surr: int
        Number of surrogates to generate to compute the p-value spectrum.
        This number should be large (n_surr>=1000 is recommended for 100
        spike trains in *sts*). If n_surr is 0, then the p-value spectrum is
        not computed.
        Default: 0

        None no maximal number of spikes is considered.
        Default: None
    max_occ: int (positive)
        Maximum number of occurrences of a sequence to be considered as a
        pattern. If None, no maximal number of occurrences is considered.
        Default: None
    min_neu: int (positive)
        Minimum number of neurons in a sequence to considered a pattern.
        Default: 1

        row corresponds to a window (order according to their position in
        time). Each column correspond to one bin and one neuron and it is 0 if
        no spikes or 1 if one or more spikes occurred in that bin for that
        particular neuron. For example, the entry [0,0] of this matrix
        corresponds to the first bin of the first window position for the first
        neuron, the entry [0,winlen] to the first bin of the first window
        position for the second neuron.
    n_subsets: int
        Number of subsets of a concept used to approximate its stability. If
        n_subset is set to 0 the stability is not computed. If, however,
        for parameters delta and epsilon (see below) delta + epsilon > 0,
        then an optimal n_subsets is calculated according to the formula given
        in Babin, Kuznetsov (2012), proposition 6:

         ..math::
                n_subset = frac{1}{2\eps^2} \ln(frac{2}{\delta}) +1

        Default:0
    delta: float
        delta: probability with at least ..math:$1-\delta$
        Default: 0
    epsilon: float
        epsilon: absolute error
        Default: 0

    Returns
    -------
    output: list
        List of all the pattern candidates (concepts) given in input, each with
        the correspondent intensional and extensional stability. Each
        pattern is represented as a tuple containing:
         (spike IDs,
        discrete times of the  occurrences of the pattern, intensional
        stability of the pattern, extensional stability of the pattern).
        The spike IDs are defined as:
        spike_id=neuron_id*bin_id; with neuron_id in [0, len(data)] and
        bin_id in [0, winlen].

    Notes
    -----
        If n_subset is larger than the extent all subsets are directly
        calculated, otherwise for small extent size an infinite
        loop can be created while doing the recursion,
        since the random generation will always contain the same
        numbers and the algorithm will be stuck searching for
        other (random) numbers

    Takes a list concepts and performs pattern set reduction (PSR).

    PSR determines which patterns in concepts_psf are statistically significant
    given any other pattern, on the basis of the pattern size and
    occurrence count ("support"). Only significant patterns are retained.
    The significance of a pattern A is evaluated through its signature
    (|A|,c_A), where |A| is the size and c_A the support of A, by either of:
    * subset filtering: any pattern B is discarded if *cfis* contains a

    * superset filtering: any pattern A is discarded if *cfis* contains a
      subset B of A such that (z_A-z_B+*k*, c_A) \in  *excluded*
    * covered-spikes criterion: for any two patterns A, B with A \subset B, B
      is discarded if (z_B-l)*c_B <= c_A*(z_A-*l*), A is discarded otherwise.
    * combined filtering: combines the three procedures above
    takes a list concepts (see output psf function) and performs
    combined filtering based on the signature (z, c) of each pattern, where
    z is the pattern size and c the pattern support.

    For any two patterns A and B in concepts_psf such that B \subset A, check:
    1) (z_B, c_B-c_A+*h*) \in *excluded*, and
    2) (z_A-z_B+*k*, c_A) \in *excluded*.
    Then:
    * if 1) and not 2): discard B
    * if 2) and not 1): discard A
    * if 1) and 2): discard B if c_B*(z_B-*l*) <= c_A*(z_A-*l*), A otherwise;
    * if neither 1) nor 2): keep both patterns.

        List of concepts, each consisting in its intent and extent
    excluded: list
        A list of non-significant pattern signatures (z, c) (see above).

    ----------
    concepts: tuple
        Each element of the tuple correspond to a pattern and it is itself a
        tuple consisting of:
            ((spikes in the pattern), (occurrences of the patterns))
    winlen: int
        Length (in bins) of the sliding window used for the analysis
    binsize: Quantity
        The time precision used to discretize the data (binning).
    pvalue_spectrum: None or tuple
        Contains a tuple of signatures and the corresponding p-value. If equal
        to None all the pvalues are set to -1
    t_start: Quantity

    --------
    output: list

            ['times'] array contianing the times (integers corresponding to the
                bin idx) of the occurrences of the patterns.
