def waveform_width(waveform, cutoff=0.75):
    """
    Calculate the width (trough-to-peak TTP) of a waveform.

    Searches for an index of a minimum within first `cutoff` of the waveform
    vector, next for a maximum after the identified minimum, and returns the
    difference between them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    waveform : array-like
        Time course of a single waveform. Accepts a list, a numpy array or a
        quantity.
    cutoff : float, optional
        Defines the normalized range `[0, cutoff]` of the input sequence for
        computing the minimum. Must be in `[0, 1)` range.
        Default: 0.75

    Returns
    -------
    width : int
        Width of a waveform expressed as a number of data points

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `waveform` is not a one-dimensional vector with at least two
        numbers.

        If `cutoff` is not in `[0, 1)` range.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from elephant.waveform_features import waveform_width
    >>> waveform_width([20, 25, 10, -5, -2, 7, 15], cutoff=0.75)

def waveform_snr(waveforms):
    """
    Return the signal-to-noise ratio of the waveforms of one or more
    spike trains :cite:`waveforms-Hatsopoulos2007_5105`.

    Signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the difference in mean peak-to-trough
    voltage divided by twice the mean SD. The mean SD is computed by
    measuring the SD of the spike waveform over all acquired spikes
    at each of the sample time points of the waveform and then averaging.

    Parameters
    ----------
    waveforms : array-like
        A list or a quantity or a numpy array of waveforms of shape
        ``(n_waveforms, time)`` in case of a single spike train or
        ``(n_waveforms, n_spiketrains, time)`` in case of one or more spike
        trains.

    Returns
    -------
    snr : float or np.ndarray
        Signal-to-noise ratio according to
        :cite:`waveforms-Hatsopoulos2007_5105`. If the input `waveforms`
        shape is ``(n_waveforms, time)`` or ``(n_waveforms, 1, time)``, a
        single float is returned. Otherwise, if the shape is
        ``(n_waveforms, n_spiketrains, time)``, a numpy array of length
        ``n_spiketrains`` is returned.

    Notes
    -----
    The waveforms of a `neo.SpikeTrain` can be extracted as
    `spiketrain.waveforms`, if it's loaded from a file, in which case you need
    to set ``load_waveforms=True`` in ``neo.read_block()``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from elephant.waveform_features import waveform_snr
    >>> waveforms = [[20, 25, 10, -5, -2, 7, 15], [17, 29, 11, -4, 0, 5, 20]]
