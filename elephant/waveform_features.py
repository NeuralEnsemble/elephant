def waveform_width(waveform, cutoff=0.75):
    """
    Calculate the width (trough-to-peak TTP) of a waveform.

    Searches for an index of a minimum within first `cutoff` of the waveform
    vector, next for a maximum after the identified minimum, and returns the
    difference between them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    waveform : np.ndarray or list or pq.Quantity
        Time course of a single waveform
    cutoff : float, optional
        Defines the normalized range `[0, cutoff]` of the input sequence for
        computing the minimum. Must be in `[0, 1)` range.
        Default: 0.75.

    Returns
    -------
    width : int
        Width of a waveform expressed as a number of data points

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `waveform` is not a one-dimensional vector with at least two
        numbers.

        If `cutoff` is not in `[0, 1)` range.

def waveform_snr(spiketrain):
    """
    Return the signal-to-noise ratio of the waveforms of a SpikeTrain.

    Signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the difference in mean peak-to-trough
    voltage divided by twice the mean SD. The mean SD is computed by
    measuring the SD of the spike waveform over all acquired spikes
    at each of the sample time points of the waveform and then averaging [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spiketrain : neo.SpikeTrain
        The spike times with attached waveforms.

    Returns
    -------
    snr : float
        signal-to-noise ratio according to [1]_

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `spiketrain` has no attached waveforms.
