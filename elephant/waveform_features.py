def waveform_snr(spiketrain):
    """
    Return the signal-to-noise ratio of the waveforms of a SpikeTrain.

    Signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the difference in mean peak-to-trough
    voltage divided by twice the mean SD. The mean SD is computed by
    measuring the SD of the spike waveform over all acquired spikes
    at each of the sample time points of the waveform and then averaging [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spiketrain : neo.SpikeTrain
        The spike times with attached waveforms.
    Returns
    -------
    snr : float
        signal-to-noise ratio according to Hatsopoulos 2007

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `spiketrain` has no attached waveforms.
