def spike_triggered_average(signal, spiketrains, window):
    """
    Calculates the spike-triggered averages of analog signals in a time window
    relative to the spike times of a corresponding spiketrain for multiple
    signals each. The function receives n analog signals and either one or
    n spiketrains. In case it is one spiketrain this one is muliplied n-fold
    and used for each of the n analog signals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : neo AnalogSignal object
        'signal' contains n analog signals.
    spiketrains : one SpikeTrain or one numpy ndarray or a list of n of either of these.
        'spiketrains' contains the times of the spikes in the spiketrains.
    window : tuple of 2 Quantity objects with dimensions of time.
        'window' is the start time and the stop time, relative to a spike, of
        the time interval for signal averaging.
        If the window size is not a multiple of the sampling interval of the
        signal the window will be extended to the next multiple.

    Returns
    -------
    result_sta : neo AnalogSignal object
        'result_sta' contains the spike-triggered averages of each of the
        analog signals with respect to the spikes in the corresponding
        spiketrains. The length of 'result_sta' is calculated as the number
        of bins from the given start and stop time of the averaging interval
        and the sampling rate of the analog signal. If for an analog signal
        no spike was either given or all given spikes had to be ignored
        because of a too large averaging interval, the corresponding returned
        analog signal has all entries as nan. The number of used spikes and
        unused spikes for each analog signal are returned as annotations to
        the returned AnalogSignal object.

    --------
    >>> import neo

def spike_field_coherence(signal, spiketrain, **kwargs):
    """
    Calculates the spike-field coherence between a analog signal(s) and a
    (binned) spike train.

    The current implementation makes use of scipy.signal.coherence(). Additional
    kwargs will will be directly forwarded to scipy.signal.coherence(),
    except for the axis parameter and the sampling frequency, which will be
    extracted from the input signals.

    The spike_field_coherence function receives an analog signal array and
    either a binned spike train or a spike train containing the original spike
    times. In case of original spike times the spike train is binned according
    to the sampling rate of the analog signal array.

    The AnalogSignal object can contain one or multiple signal traces. In case
    of multiple signal traces, the spike field coherence is calculated
    individually for each signal trace and the spike train.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : neo AnalogSignal object
        'signal' contains n analog signals.
    spiketrain : SpikeTrain or BinnedSpikeTrain
        Single spike train to perform the analysis on. The bin_size of the
        binned spike train must match the sampling_rate of signal.
    **kwargs:
        All kwargs are passed to `scipy.signal.coherence()`.

    Returns
    -------
    coherence : complex Quantity array
        contains the coherence values calculated for each analog signal trace
        in combination with the spike train. The first dimension corresponds to
        the frequency, the second to the number of the signal trace.
    frequencies : Quantity array
        contains the frequency values corresponding to the first dimension of
        the 'coherence' array

    Examples
    --------

    Plot the SFC between a regular spike train at 20 Hz, and two sinusoidal
    time series at 20 Hz and 23 Hz, respectively.
