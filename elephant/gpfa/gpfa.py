"""
Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA) is a dimensionality reduction method
:cite:`gpfa-Yu2008_1881` for neural trajectory visualization of parallel spike
trains. GPFA applies factor analysis (FA) to time-binned spike count data to
reduce the dimensionality and at the same time smoothes the resulting
low-dimensional trajectories by fitting a Gaussian process (GP) model to them.

The input consists of a set of trials (Y), each containing a list of spike
trains (N neurons). The output is the projection (X) of the data in a space
of pre-chosen dimensionality x_dim < N.

Under the assumption of a linear relation (transform matrix C) between the
latent variable X following a Gaussian process and the spike train data Y with
a bias d and  a noise term of zero mean and (co)variance R (i.e.,
:math:`Y = C X + d + Gauss(0,R)`), the projection corresponds to the
conditional probability E[X|Y].
The parameters (C, d, R) as well as the time scales and variances of the
Gaussian process are estimated from the data using an expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm.

Internally, the analysis consists of the following steps:

0) bin the spike train data to get a sequence of N dimensional vectors of spike
counts in respective time bins, and choose the reduced dimensionality x_dim

1) expectation-maximization for fitting of the parameters C, d, R and the
time-scales and variances of the Gaussian process, using all the trials
provided as input (c.f., `gpfa_core.em()`)

2) projection of single trials in the low dimensional space (c.f.,
`gpfa_core.exact_inference_with_ll()`)

3) orthonormalization of the matrix C and the corresponding subspace, for
visualization purposes: (c.f., `gpfa_core.orthonormalize()`)

class GPFA(sklearn.base.BaseEstimator):
    r"""
    Apply Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA) to spike train data

    There are two principle scenarios of using the GPFA analysis, both of which
    can be performed in an instance of the GPFA() class.

    In the first scenario, only one single dataset is used to fit the model and
    to extract the neural trajectories. The parameters that describe the
    transformation are first extracted from the data using the `fit()` method
    of the GPFA class. Then the same data is projected into the orthonormal
    basis using the method `transform()`. The `fit_transform()` method can be
    used to perform these two steps at once.

    In the second scenario, a single dataset is split into training and test
    datasets. Here, the parameters are estimated from the training data. Then
    the test data is projected into the low-dimensional space previously
    obtained from the training data. This analysis is performed by executing
    first the `fit()` method on the training data, followed by the
    `transform()` method on the test dataset.

    The GPFA class is compatible to the cross-validation functions of
    `sklearn.model_selection`, such that users can perform cross-validation to
    search for a set of parameters yielding best performance using these
    functions.
