Examples
--------

0) Create `ASSET` class object that holds spike trains.

   `ASSET` requires at least one argument - a list of spike trains. If
   `spiketrains_y` is not provided, the same spike trains are used to build an
   intersection matrix with.

   >>> import neo
   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> import quantities as pq
   >>> from elephant import asset

   >>> spiketrains = [
   ...      neo.SpikeTrain([start, start + 6] * (3 * pq.ms) + 10 * pq.ms,
   ...                     t_stop=60 * pq.ms)
   ...      for _ in range(3)
   ...      for start in range(3)
   ... ]
   >>> asset_obj = asset.ASSET(spiketrains, bin_size=3*pq.ms, verbose=False)

1) Build the intersection matrix `imat`:

   >>> imat = asset_obj.intersection_matrix()

2) Estimate the probability matrix `pmat`, using the analytical method:

   >>> pmat = asset_obj.probability_matrix_analytical(imat,
   ...                                                kernel_width=9*pq.ms)

3) Compute the joint probability matrix `jmat`, using a suitable filter:

   >>> jmat = asset_obj.joint_probability_matrix(pmat, filter_shape=(5, 1),
   ...                                           n_largest=3)

4) Create the masked version of the intersection matrix, `mmat`, from `pmat`
   and `jmat`:

   >>> mmat = asset_obj.mask_matrices([pmat, jmat], thresholds=.9)

5) Cluster significant elements of imat into diagonal structures:

   >>> cmat = asset_obj.cluster_matrix_entries(mmat, max_distance=3,
   ...                                         min_neighbors=3, stretch=5)

6) Extract sequences of synchronous events:

   >>> sses = asset_obj.extract_synchronous_events(cmat)

The ASSET found 2 sequences of synchronous events:

   >>> from pprint import pprint
   >>> pprint(sses)
   {1: {(9, 3): {0, 3, 6}, (10, 4): {1, 4, 7}, (11, 5): {8, 2, 5}}}

def _stretched_metric_2d(x, y, stretch, ref_angle):
    r"""
    Given a list of points on the real plane, identified by their abscissa `x`
    and ordinate `y`, compute a stretched transformation of the Euclidean
    distance among each of them.

    The classical euclidean distance `d` between points `(x1, y1)` and
    `(x2, y2)`, i.e., :math:`\sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)`, is multiplied by a
    factor

    where :math:`\theta` is the angle between the points and the 45 degree
    direction (i.e., the line `y = x`).

    The stretching factor thus steadily varies between 1 (if the line
    connecting `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` has inclination `ref_angle`) and
    `stretch` (if that line has inclination `90 + ref_angle`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (n,) np.ndarray
        Array of abscissas of all points among which to compute the distance.

        Given a list of parallel spike trains, estimate the cumulative
        probability of each entry in their intersection matrix by a Monte Carlo
        approach using surrogate data.

        Contrarily to the analytical version (see
        :func:`ASSET.probability_matrix_analytical`) the Monte Carlo one does
        not incorporate the assumptions of Poissonianity in the null
        hypothesis.

        The method produces surrogate spike trains (using one of several
        methods at disposal, see "Parameters" section) and calculates their
        intersection matrix `M`. For each entry `(i, j)`, the intersection CDF
        `P[i, j]` is then given by:

        .. centered::  P[i, j] = #(spike_train_surrogates such that
                       M[i, j] < I[i, j]) / #(spike_train_surrogates)

        If `P[i, j]` is large (close to 1), `I[i, j]` is statistically
        significant: the probability to observe an overlap equal to or larger
        than `I[i, j]` under the null hypothesis is `1 - P[i, j]`, very small.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n_surrogates : int
            The number of spike train surrogates to generate for the bootstrap

            The floating point intersection matrix of a list of spike trains.
            It has the shape `(n, n)`, where `n` is the number of bins that
            time was discretized in.
            If None, the output of :func:`ASSET.intersection_matrix` is used.
            Default: None
        surrogate_method : {'dither_spike_train', 'dither_spikes',

            information about each surrogate method. Note that some of these
            methods need `surrogate_dt` parameter, others ignore it.
            Default: 'dither_spike_train'.
        surrogate_dt : pq.Quantity, optional
            For surrogate methods shifting spike times randomly around their
            original time ('dither_spike_train', 'dither_spikes') or replacing
            them randomly within a certain window ('jitter_spikes'),
            `surrogate_dt` represents the size of that shift (window). For
            other methods, `surrogate_dt` is ignored.
            If None, it's set to `self.bin_size * 5`.
            Default: None.

        Returns
        -------
        pmat : np.ndarray
            The cumulative probability matrix. `pmat[i, j]` represents the
            estimated probability of having an overlap between bins `i` and `j`

        Given a list of spike trains, approximates the cumulative probability
        of each entry in their intersection matrix.

        The approximation is analytical and works under the assumptions that
        the input spike trains are independent and Poisson. It works as
        follows:

            * Bin each spike train at the specified `bin_size`: this yields a
              binary array of 1s (spike in bin) and 0s (no spike in bin;
              clipping used);
            * If required, estimate the rate profile of each spike train by
              convolving the binned array with a boxcar kernel of user-defined
              length;
            * For each neuron `k` and each pair of bins `i` and `j`, compute
              the probability :math:`p_ijk` that neuron `k` fired in both bins
              `i` and `j`.
            * Approximate the probability distribution of the intersection
              value at `(i, j)` by a Poisson distribution with mean parameter
              :math:`l = \sum_k (p_ijk)`,
              justified by Le Cam's approximation of a sum of independent
              Bernouilli random variables with a Poisson distribution.

        r"""
        Given a matrix `mask_matrix`, replaces its positive elements with
        integers representing different cluster IDs. Each cluster comprises
        close-by elements.

        In ASSET analysis, `mask_matrix` is a thresholded ("masked") version
        of the intersection matrix `imat`, whose values are those of `imat`
        only if considered statistically significant, and zero otherwise.

        A cluster is built by pooling elements according to their distance,
        via the DBSCAN algorithm (see `sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN` class). Elements
        form a neighbourhood if at least one of them has a distance not larger
        than `max_distance` from the others, and if they are at least
        `min_neighbors`. Overlapping neighborhoods form a cluster:

            * Clusters are assigned integers from `1` to the total number `k`
              of clusters;
            * Unclustered ("isolated") positive elements of `mask_matrix` are
              assigned value `-1`;
            * Non-positive elements are assigned the value `0`.

        The distance between the positions of two positive elements in
        `mask_matrix` is given by a Euclidean metric which is stretched if the
        two positions are not aligned along the 45 degree direction (the main
        diagonal direction), as more, with maximal stretching along the
        anti-diagonal. Specifically, the Euclidean distance between positions
        `(i1, j1)` and `(i2, j2)` is stretched by a factor

        .. math::
                 1 + (\mathtt{stretch} - 1.) *
                 \left|\sin((\pi / 4) - \theta)\right|,

        where :math:`\theta` is the angle between the pixels and the 45 degree
        direction. The stretching factor thus varies between 1 and `stretch`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mask_matrix : np.ndarray
            The boolean matrix, whose elements with positive values are to be
            clustered. The output of :func:`ASSET.mask_matrices`.
        max_distance : float
            The maximum distance between two elements in `mask_matrix` to be
            a part of the same neighbourhood in the DBSCAN algorithm.
        min_neighbors : int
            The minimum number of elements to form a neighbourhood.
        stretch : float
            The stretching factor of the euclidean metric for elements aligned
            along the 135 degree direction (anti-diagonal). The actual
            stretching increases from 1 to `stretch` as the direction of the
            two elements moves from the 45 to the 135 degree direction.
            `stretch` must be greater than 1.

        Returns
        -------
        cluster_mat : np.ndarray
            A matrix with the same shape of `mask_matrix`, each of whose
            elements is either:

                * a positive integer (cluster ID) if the element is part of a
                  cluster;
                * `0` if the corresponding element in `mask_matrix` is
                  non-positive;
