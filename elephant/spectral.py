    Estimates power spectrum density (PSD) of a given `neo.AnalogSignal`
    using Welch's method.

    The PSD is obtained through the following steps:

    1. Cut the given data into several overlapping segments. The degree of
       overlap can be specified by parameter `overlap` (default is 0.5,
       i.e. segments are overlapped by the half of their length).
       The number and the length of the segments are determined according
       to the parameters `n_segments`, `len_segment` or `frequency_resolution`.
       By default, the data is cut into 8 segments;

    2. Apply a window function to each segment. Hanning window is used by
       default. This can be changed by giving a window function or an
       array as parameter `window` (see Notes [2]);

    3. Compute the periodogram of each segment;

    4. Average the obtained periodograms to yield PSD estimate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : neo.AnalogSignal or pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        Time series data, of which PSD is estimated. When `signal` is
        `pq.Quantity` or `np.ndarray`, sampling frequency should be given
        through the keyword argument `fs`. Otherwise, the default value is
        used (`fs` = 1.0).
    n_segments : int, optional
        Number of segments. The length of segments is adjusted so that
        overlapping segments cover the entire stretch of the given data. This
        parameter is ignored if `len_segment` or `frequency_resolution` is
        given.
        Default: 8
    len_segment : int, optional
        Length of segments. This parameter is ignored if `frequency_resolution`
        is given. If None, it will be determined from other parameters.
        Default: None
    frequency_resolution : pq.Quantity or float, optional
        Desired frequency resolution of the obtained PSD estimate in terms of
        the interval between adjacent frequency bins. When given as a `float`,
        it is taken as frequency in Hz.
        If None, it will be determined from other parameters.
        Default: None
    overlap : float, optional
        Overlap between segments represented as a float number between 0 (no
        overlap) and 1 (complete overlap).
        Default: 0.5 (half-overlapped)
    fs : pq.Quantity or float, optional
        Specifies the sampling frequency of the input time series. When the
        input is given as a `neo.AnalogSignal`, the sampling frequency is
        taken from its attribute and this parameter is ignored.
        Default: 1.0
    window : str or tuple or np.ndarray, optional
        Desired window to use.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: 'hann'
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: None
    detrend : str or function or False, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: 'constant'
    return_onesided : bool, optional
        If True, return a one-sided spectrum for real data.
        If False return a two-sided spectrum.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: True
    scaling : {'density', 'spectrum'}, optional
        If 'density', computes the power spectral density where Pxx has units
        of V**2/Hz. If 'spectrum', computes the power spectrum where Pxx has
        units of V**2, if `signal` is measured in V and `fs` is measured in
        Hz.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: 'density'
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the periodogram is computed.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: last axis (-1)

    Returns
    -------
    freqs : pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        Frequencies associated with the power estimates in `psd`.
        `freqs` is always a vector irrespective of the shape of the input
        data in `signal`.
        If `signal` is `neo.AnalogSignal` or `pq.Quantity`, a `pq.Quantity`
        array is returned.
        Otherwise, a `np.ndarray` containing frequency in Hz is returned.
    psd : pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        PSD estimates of the time series in `signal`.
        If `signal` is `neo.AnalogSignal`, a `pq.Quantity` array is returned.
        Otherwise, the return is a `np.ndarray`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `overlap` is not in the interval `[0, 1)`.

        If `frequency_resolution` is not positive.

        If `frequency_resolution` is too high for the given data size.

        If `frequency_resolution` is None and `len_segment` is not a positive
        number.

        If `frequency_resolution` is None and `len_segment` is greater than the
        length of data at `axis`.

        If both `frequency_resolution` and `len_segment` are None and
        `n_segments` is not a positive number.

        If both `frequency_resolution` and `len_segment` are None and
        `n_segments` is greater than the length of data at `axis`.

    Notes
    -----
    1. The computation steps used in this function are implemented in
       `scipy.signal` module, and this function is a wrapper which provides
       a proper set of parameters to `scipy.signal.welch` function.
    2. The parameters `window`, `nfft`, `detrend`, `return_onesided`,
       `scaling`, and `axis` are directly passed to the `scipy.signal.welch`
       function. See the respective descriptions in the docstring of
       `scipy.signal.welch` for usage.
    3. When only `n_segments` is given, parameter `nperseg` of
       `scipy.signal.welch` function is determined according to the expression

       `signal.shape[axis] / (n_segments - overlap * (n_segments - 1))`

       converted to integer.

    """
    Estimates the cross spectrum of a given `neo.AnalogSignal` using the
    Multitaper method.

    The cross spectrum is obtained through the following steps:

    1. Obtain approximately independent estimates of the spectrum for each
       signal by multiplying it with tapering functions (obtained as
       the discrete prolate spheroidal functions, also known as slepian
       functions) and calculating the cross spectrum for the tapered signals.
       The number of tapering functions (and hence the number of the estimates)
       is specified by the parameter `num_tapers`.

    2. Average the approximately independent estimates of each tapered
       instance of the signal to decrease overall variance of the estimates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signals : neo.AnalogSignal or pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        Time series data of which PSD is estimated. When `signal` is
        `np.ndarray` or `pq.Quantity`, it needs to be passed as a 2-dimensional
        array of shape (n_channels, n_samples), and the data sampling frequency
        should be given through the keyword argument `fs`.
    fs : float, optional
        Specifies the sampling frequency of the input time series
        Default: 1.0
    nw : float, optional
        Time-halfbandwidth product. This parameter can be used to determine the
        number of tapers following the equation:

            num_tapers = 2*nw - 1

        It can be determined by multiplying the duration of the signal with the
        desired half-peak resolution frequency:

            n_samples/fs * peak_resolution/2.

        Default: 4.0
    num_tapers : int, optional
        Number of tapers used in step 2 (see above) to obtain estimate of PSD.
        By default, [2*nw] - 1 is chosen.
        Default: None (see Notes [1])
    peak_resolution : pq.Quantity float, optional
        Quantity in Hz determining the number of tapers used for analysis.
        Fine peak resolution --> low numerical value --> low number of tapers
        High peak resolution --> high numerical value --> high number of tapers
        When given as a `float`, it is taken as frequency in Hz.
        Default: None (see Notes [1])
    return_onesided : bool, optional
        If True, return a one-sided spectrum for real data.
        If False return a two-sided spectrum.
        Default: True
    attach_units : bool, optional
        If True and signals is instance of pq.Quantity, units are attached to
        the estimated cross spectrum.
        Default: True

    Notes
    -----
    1. There is a parameter hierarchy regarding `nw`, `num_tapers` and
       `peak_resolution`. If peak_resolution is provided, it determines both
       `nw` and the `num_tapers`. Specifying `num_tapers` has an effect only if
       `peak_resolution` is not provided.

    Returns
    -------
    freqs : np.ndarray
        Frequencies associated with cross spectrum estimate in `cross_spec`. If
        signals is an instance of `neo.AnalogSignal` or `Quantity` and the
        `attach_units` is set to `True`, the returned values will have units of
        Hz.
    cross_spec : np.ndarray
        Estimate of the cross spectrum of time series in `signals`. If signals
        is an instance of `neo.AnalogSignal` or `Quantity` and the
        `attach_units` is set to `True`, the returned values will have units
        attached to them (i.e. signals.units ** 2/Hz).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `peak_resolution` is None and `num_tapers` is not a positive number.

    TypeError
        If `peak_resolution` is None and `num_tapers` is not an int.

    The spectral measure is computed on each segment by a given function.
    The underlying assumption is the spectral measures computed for the
    segments are approximately independent.

    The spectral measure is obtained through the following steps

    1. Cut the given data into several overlapping segments. The degree of
       overlap can be specified by parameter `overlap` (default is 0.5,
       i.e. segments are overlapped by the half of their length).

        parameter is ignored if `len_segment` or `frequency_resolution` is
        given.
        Default: 1
    len_segment : int, optional
        Length of segments. This parameter is ignored if `frequency_resolution`
        is given. If None, it will be determined from other parameters.
        Default: None
    frequency_resolution : pq.Quantity or float, optional
        Desired frequency resolution of the obtained PSD estimate in terms of
        the interval between adjacent frequency bins. When given as a `float`,
        it is taken as frequency in Hz.
        If None, it will be determined from other parameters.
        Default: None
    overlap : float, optional
        Overlap between segments represented as a float number between 0 (no

        Specifies the sampling frequency of the input time series

        Desired frequency resolution of the obtained coherence estimate in
        terms of the interval between adjacent frequency bins. When given as a

    r"""
    Estimates coherence between a given pair of analog signals.

    The estimation is performed with Welch's method: the given pair of data
    are cut into short segments, cross-spectra are calculated for each pair of
    segments, and the cross-spectra are averaged and normalized by respective
    auto-spectra.

    By default, the data are cut into 8 segments with 50% overlap between
    neighboring segments. These numbers can be changed through respective
    parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal_i : neo.AnalogSignal or pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        First time series data of the pair between which coherence is
        computed.
    signal_j : neo.AnalogSignal or pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        Second time series data of the pair between which coherence is
        computed.
        The shapes and the sampling frequencies of `signal_i` and `signal_j`
        must be identical. When `signal_i` and `signal_j` are not
        `neo.AnalogSignal`, sampling frequency should be specified through the
        keyword argument `fs`. Otherwise, the default value is used
        (`fs` = 1.0).
    n_segments : int, optional
        Number of segments. The length of segments is adjusted so that
        overlapping segments cover the entire stretch of the given data. This
        parameter is ignored if `len_seg` or `frequency_resolution` is given.
        Default: 8
    len_segment : int, optional
        Length of segments. This parameter is ignored if `frequency_resolution`
        is given. If None, it is determined from other parameters.
        Default: None
    frequency_resolution : pq.Quantity or float, optional
        Desired frequency resolution of the obtained coherence estimate in
        terms of the interval between adjacent frequency bins. When given as a
        `float`, it is taken as frequency in Hz.
        If None, it is determined from other parameters.
        Default: None
    overlap : float, optional
        Overlap between segments represented as a float number between 0 (no
        overlap) and 1 (complete overlap).
        Default: 0.5 (half-overlapped)
    fs : pq.Quantity or float, optional
        Specifies the sampling frequency of the input time series. When the
        input time series are given as `neo.AnalogSignal`, the sampling
        frequency is taken from their attribute and this parameter is ignored.
        Default: 1.0
    window : str or tuple or np.ndarray, optional
        Desired window to use.
        See Notes [1].
        Default: 'hann'
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used.
        See Notes [1].
        Default: None
    detrend : str or function or False, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment.
        See Notes [1].
        Default: 'constant'
    scaling : {'density', 'spectrum'}, optional
        If 'density', computes the power spectral density where Pxx has units
        of V**2/Hz. If 'spectrum', computes the power spectrum where Pxx has
        units of V**2, if `signal` is measured in V and `fs` is measured in
        Hz.
        See Notes [1].
        Default: 'density'
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the periodogram is computed.
        See Notes [1].
        Default: last axis (-1)

    Returns
    -------
    freqs : pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        Frequencies associated with the estimates of coherency and phase lag.
        `freqs` is always a vector irrespective of the shape of the input
        data. If `signal_i` and `signal_j` are `neo.AnalogSignal` or
        `pq.Quantity`, a `pq.Quantity` array is returned. Otherwise, a
        `np.ndarray` containing frequency in Hz is returned.
    coherency : np.ndarray
        Estimate of coherency between the input time series. For each
        frequency, coherency takes a value between 0 and 1, with 0 or 1
        representing no or perfect coherence, respectively.
        When the input arrays `signal_i` and `signal_j` are multidimensional,
        `coherency` is of the same shape as the inputs, and the frequency is
        indexed depending on the type of the input. If the input is
        `neo.AnalogSignal`, the first axis indexes frequency. Otherwise,
        frequency is indexed by the last axis.
    phase_lag : pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        Estimate of phase lag in radian between the input time series. For
        each frequency, phase lag takes a value between :math:`-\pi` and
        :math:`\pi`, with positive values meaning phase precession of
        `signal_i` ahead of `signal_j`, and vice versa. If `signal_i` and
        `signal_j` are `neo.AnalogSignal` or `pq.Quantity`, a `pq.Quantity`
        array is returned. Otherwise, a `np.ndarray` containing phase lag in
        radian is returned. The axis for frequency index is determined in the
        same way as for `coherency`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Same as in :func:`welch_psd`.

    Notes
    -----
    1. The computation steps used in this function are implemented in
       `scipy.signal` module, and this function is a wrapper which provides
       a proper set of parameters to `scipy.signal.welch` function.
    2. The parameters `window`, `nfft`, `detrend`, `return_onesided`,
       `scaling`, and `axis` are directly passed to the `scipy.signal.welch`
       function. See the respective descriptions in the docstring of
       `scipy.signal.welch` for usage.
    3. When only `n_segments` is given, parameter `nperseg` of
       `scipy.signal.welch` function is determined according to the expression

       `signal.shape[axis] / (n_segments - overlap * (n_segments - 1))`

       converted to integer.
