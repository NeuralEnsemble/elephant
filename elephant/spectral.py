    Estimates power spectrum density (PSD) of a given `neo.AnalogSignal`
    using Welch's method.

    The PSD is obtained through the following steps:

    1. Cut the given data into several overlapping segments. The degree of
       overlap can be specified by parameter `overlap` (default is 0.5,
       i.e. segments are overlapped by the half of their length).
       The number and the length of the segments are determined according
       to the parameters `n_segments`, `len_segment` or `frequency_resolution`.
       By default, the data is cut into 8 segments;

    2. Apply a window function to each segment. Hanning window is used by
       default. This can be changed by giving a window function or an
       array as parameter `window` (see Notes [2]);

    3. Compute the periodogram of each segment;

    4. Average the obtained periodograms to yield PSD estimate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : neo.AnalogSignal or pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        Time series data, of which PSD is estimated. When `signal` is
        `pq.Quantity` or `np.ndarray`, sampling frequency should be given
        through the keyword argument `fs`. Otherwise, the default value is
        used (`fs` = 1.0).
    n_segments : int, optional
        Number of segments. The length of segments is adjusted so that
        overlapping segments cover the entire stretch of the given data. This
        parameter is ignored if `len_segment` or `frequency_resolution` is
        given.
        Default: 8.
    len_segment : int, optional
        Length of segments. This parameter is ignored if `frequency_resolution`
        is given. If None, it will be determined from other parameters.
        Default: None.
    frequency_resolution : pq.Quantity or float, optional
        Desired frequency resolution of the obtained PSD estimate in terms of
        the interval between adjacent frequency bins. When given as a `float`,
        it is taken as frequency in Hz.
        If None, it will be determined from other parameters.
        Default: None.
    overlap : float, optional
        Overlap between segments represented as a float number between 0 (no
        overlap) and 1 (complete overlap).
        Default: 0.5 (half-overlapped).
    fs : pq.Quantity or float, optional
        Specifies the sampling frequency of the input time series. When the
        input is given as a `neo.AnalogSignal`, the sampling frequency is
        taken from its attribute and this parameter is ignored.
        Default: 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or np.ndarray, optional
        Desired window to use.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: 'hanning'.
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: None.
    detrend : str or function or False, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: 'constant'.
    return_onesided : bool, optional
        If True, return a one-sided spectrum for real data.
        If False return a two-sided spectrum.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: True.
    scaling : {'density', 'spectrum'}, optional
        If 'density', computes the power spectral density where Pxx has units
        of V**2/Hz. If 'spectrum', computes the power spectrum where Pxx has
        units of V**2, if `signal` is measured in V and `fs` is measured in
        Hz.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: 'density'.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the periodogram is computed.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: last axis (-1).

    Returns
    -------
    freqs : pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        Frequencies associated with the power estimates in `psd`.
        `freqs` is always a vector irrespective of the shape of the input
        data in `signal`.
        If `signal` is `neo.AnalogSignal` or `pq.Quantity`, a `pq.Quantity`
        array is returned.
        Otherwise, a `np.ndarray` containing frequency in Hz is returned.
    psd : pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        PSD estimates of the time series in `signal`.
        If `signal` is `neo.AnalogSignal`, a `pq.Quantity` array is returned.
        Otherwise, the return is a `np.ndarray`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `overlap` is not in the interval `[0, 1)`.

        If `frequency_resolution` is not positive.

        If `frequency_resolution` is too high for the given data size.

        If `frequency_resolution` is None and `len_segment` is not a positive
        number.

        If `frequency_resolution` is None and `len_segment` is greater than the
        length of data at `axis`.

        If both `frequency_resolution` and `len_segment` are None and
        `n_segments` is not a positive number.

        If both `frequency_resolution` and `len_segment` are None and
        `n_segments` is greater than the length of data at `axis`.

    1. The computation steps used in this function are implemented in
       `scipy.signal` module, and this function is a wrapper which provides
       a proper set of parameters to `scipy.signal.welch` function.
    2. The parameters `window`, `nfft`, `detrend`, `return_onesided`,
       `scaling`, and `axis` are directly passed to the `scipy.signal.welch`
       function. See the respective descriptions in the docstring of
       `scipy.signal.welch` for usage.
    3. When only `n_segments` is given, parameter `nperseg` of
       `scipy.signal.welch` function is determined according to the expression

       `signal.shape[axis] / (n_segments - overlap * (n_segments - 1))`

    Estimates coherence between a given pair of analog signals.

    The estimation is performed with Welch's method: the given pair of data
    are cut into short segments, cross-spectra are calculated for each pair of
    segments, and the cross-spectra are averaged and normalized by respective
    auto-spectra.

    By default, the data are cut into 8 segments with 50% overlap between
    neighboring segments. These numbers can be changed through respective
    parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal_i : neo.AnalogSignal or pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        First time series data of the pair between which coherence is
        computed.
    signal_j : neo.AnalogSignal or pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        Second time series data of the pair between which coherence is
        computed.
        The shapes and the sampling frequencies of `signal_i` and `signal_j`
        must be identical. When `signal_i` and `signal_j` are not
        `neo.AnalogSignal`, sampling frequency should be specified through the
        keyword argument `fs`. Otherwise, the default value is used
        (`fs` = 1.0).
    n_segments : int, optional
        Number of segments. The length of segments is adjusted so that
        overlapping segments cover the entire stretch of the given data. This
        parameter is ignored if `len_seg` or `frequency_resolution` is given.
        Default: 8.
    len_segment : int, optional
        Length of segments. This parameter is ignored if `frequency_resolution`
        is given. If None, it is determined from other parameters.
        Default: None.
    frequency_resolution : pq.Quantity or float, optional
        Desired frequency resolution of the obtained coherence estimate in
        terms of the interval between adjacent frequency bins. When given as a
        `float`, it is taken as frequency in Hz.
        If None, it is determined from other parameters.
        Default: None.
    overlap : float, optional
        Overlap between segments represented as a float number between 0 (no
        overlap) and 1 (complete overlap).
        Default: 0.5 (half-overlapped).
    fs : pq.Quantity or float, optional
        Specifies the sampling frequency of the input time series. When the
        input time series are given as `neo.AnalogSignal`, the sampling
        frequency is taken from their attribute and this parameter is ignored.
        Default: 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or np.ndarray, optional
        Desired window to use.
        See Notes [1].
        Default: 'hanning'.
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used.
        See Notes [1].
        Default: None.
    detrend : str or function or False, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment.
        See Notes [1].
        Default: 'constant'.
    scaling : {'density', 'spectrum'}, optional
        If 'density', computes the power spectral density where Pxx has units
        of V**2/Hz. If 'spectrum', computes the power spectrum where Pxx has
        units of V**2, if `signal` is measured in V and `fs` is measured in
        Hz.
        See Notes [1].
        Default: 'density'.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the periodogram is computed.
        See Notes [1].
        Default: last axis (-1).

    Returns
    -------
    freqs : pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        Frequencies associated with the estimates of coherency and phase lag.
        `freqs` is always a vector irrespective of the shape of the input
        data. If `signal_i` and `signal_j` are `neo.AnalogSignal` or
        `pq.Quantity`, a `pq.Quantity` array is returned. Otherwise, a
        `np.ndarray` containing frequency in Hz is returned.
    coherency : np.ndarray
        Estimate of coherency between the input time series. For each
        frequency, coherency takes a value between 0 and 1, with 0 or 1
        representing no or perfect coherence, respectively.
        When the input arrays `signal_i` and `signal_j` are multi-dimensional,
        `coherency` is of the same shape as the inputs, and the frequency is
        indexed depending on the type of the input. If the input is
        `neo.AnalogSignal`, the first axis indexes frequency. Otherwise,
        frequency is indexed by the last axis.
    phase_lag : pq.Quantity or np.ndarray
        Estimate of phase lag in radian between the input time series. For
        each frequency, phase lag takes a value between :math:`-\pi` and
        :math:`\pi`, with positive values meaning phase precession of
        `signal_i` ahead of `signal_j`, and vice versa. If `signal_i` and
        `signal_j` are `neo.AnalogSignal` or `pq.Quantity`, a `pq.Quantity`
        array is returned. Otherwise, a `np.ndarray` containing phase lag in
        radian is returned. The axis for frequency index is determined in the
        same way as for `coherency`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Same as in :func:`welch_psd`.
