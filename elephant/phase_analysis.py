def spike_triggered_phase(hilbert_transform, spiketrains, interpolate):
    """
    Calculate the set of spike-triggered phases of a `neo.AnalogSignal`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hilbert_transform : neo.AnalogSignal or list of neo.AnalogSignal
        `neo.AnalogSignal` of the complex analytic signal (e.g., returned by
        the `elephant.signal_processing.hilbert` function).
        If `hilbert_transform` is only one signal, all spike trains are
        compared to this signal. Otherwise, length of `hilbert_transform` must
        match the length of `spiketrains`.
    spiketrains : neo.SpikeTrain or list of neo.SpikeTrain
        Spike trains on which to trigger `hilbert_transform` extraction.
    interpolate : bool
        If True, the phases and amplitudes of `hilbert_transform` for spikes
        falling between two samples of signal is interpolated.
        If False, the closest sample of `hilbert_transform` is used.

    Returns
    -------
    phases : list of np.ndarray
        Spike-triggered phases. Entries in the list correspond to the
        `neo.SpikeTrain`s in `spiketrains`. Each entry contains an array with
        the spike-triggered angles (in rad) of the signal.
    amp : list of pq.Quantity
        Corresponding spike-triggered amplitudes.
    times : list of pq.Quantity
        A list of times corresponding to the signal. They correspond to the
        times of the `neo.SpikeTrain` referred by the list item.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the number of spike trains and number of phase signals don't match,
        and neither of the two are a single signal.

def phase_locking_value(phases_i, phases_j):
    r"""
    Calculates the phase locking value (PLV).

    This function expects the phases of two signals (each containing multiple
    trials). For each trial pair, it calculates the phase difference at each
    time point. Then it calculates the mean vectors of those phase differences
    across all trials. The PLV at time `t` is the length of the corresponding
    mean vector.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phases_i, phases_j : (t, n) np.ndarray
        Time-series of the first and second signals, with `t` time points and
        `n` trials.

    Returns
    -------
    plv : (t,) np.ndarray
        Vector of floats with the phase-locking value at each time point.
        Range: :math:`[0, 1]`

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the shapes of `phases_i` and `phases_j` are different.

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is based on the formula taken from [1] (pp. 195):

    .. math::
        PLV_t = \frac{1}{N} \left |
        \sum_{n=1}^N \exp(i \cdot \theta(t, n)) \right | \\

    where :math:`\theta(t, n) = \phi_x(t, n) - \phi_y(t, n)`
    is the phase difference at time `t` for trial `n`.
