def spike_triggered_phase(hilbert_transform, spiketrains, interpolate):
    """
    Calculate the set of spike-triggered phases of a `neo.AnalogSignal`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hilbert_transform : neo.AnalogSignal or list of neo.AnalogSignal
        `neo.AnalogSignal` of the complex analytic signal (e.g., returned by
        the `elephant.signal_processing.hilbert` function).
        If `hilbert_transform` is only one signal, all spike trains are
        compared to this signal. Otherwise, length of `hilbert_transform` must
        match the length of `spiketrains`.
    spiketrains : neo.SpikeTrain or list of neo.SpikeTrain
        Spike trains on which to trigger `hilbert_transform` extraction.
    interpolate : bool
        If True, the phases and amplitudes of `hilbert_transform` for spikes
        falling between two samples of signal is interpolated.
        If False, the closest sample of `hilbert_transform` is used.

    Returns
    -------
    phases : list of np.ndarray
        Spike-triggered phases. Entries in the list correspond to the
        `neo.SpikeTrain`s in `spiketrains`. Each entry contains an array with
        the spike-triggered angles (in rad) of the signal.
    amp : list of pq.Quantity
        Corresponding spike-triggered amplitudes.
    times : list of pq.Quantity
        A list of times corresponding to the signal. They correspond to the
        times of the `neo.SpikeTrain` referred by the list item.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the number of spike trains and number of phase signals don't match,
        and neither of the two are a single signal.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a 20 Hz oscillatory signal sampled at 1 kHz and a random Poisson
    spike train, then calculate spike-triggered phases and amplitudes of the
    oscillation:

    >>> import neo
    >>> import elephant
    >>> import quantities as pq
    >>> import numpy as np
    ...
    >>> f_osc = 20. * pq.Hz
    >>> f_sampling = 1 * pq.ms
    >>> tlen = 100 * pq.s
    ...
    >>> time_axis = np.arange(
    ...     0, tlen.magnitude,
    ...     f_sampling.rescale(pq.s).magnitude) * pq.s
    >>> analogsignal = neo.AnalogSignal(
    ...     np.sin(2 * np.pi * (f_osc * time_axis).simplified.magnitude),
    ...     units=pq.mV, t_start=0*pq.ms, sampling_period=f_sampling)
    >>> spiketrain = (elephant.spike_train_generation.
    ...     homogeneous_poisson_process(
    ...     50 * pq.Hz, t_start=0.0*pq.ms, t_stop=tlen.rescale(pq.ms)))
    ...
    >>> phases, amps, times = elephant.phase_analysis.spike_triggered_phase(
    ...     elephant.signal_processing.hilbert(analogsignal),
    ...     spiketrain,
    ...     interpolate=True)
