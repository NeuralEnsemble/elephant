"""
The ``elephant.parallel`` package provides classes to parallelize calls to any
user-specified function.

The typical use case is calling a function many times with different
parameters.

.. note::  This parallelization module is independent from Elephant and can be
           used to parallelize mutually independent calls to arbitrary
           functions.
