"""
This module defines the basic classes that represent trials in Elephant.

Many neuroscience methods rely on the concept of repeated trials to improve the
estimate of quantities measured from the data. Typically, trials are
considered as fixed time intervals tied to a specific event in the experiment,
such as the onset of a stimulus. In the simplest case, results from multiple
trials are averaged. In other scenarios, more intricate steps must be taken
in order to pool information from each repetition of a trial.

Neo does not impose a specific way to represent trial data. A natural way to
represent trials is to have a :class:`neo.Block` containing multiple
:class:`neo.Segment` objects, each representing the data of one trial. Another
popular option is to store trials as a list of lists, where the outer refers to
the collection of trials, and inner lists contain Neo data objects
(:class:`neo.SpikeTrain` and :class:`neo.AnalogSignal`) containing the
individual data of each trial.

The classes of this module abstract from these specific data representations
by introducing a set of :class:`Trials` classes with a common API. These
classes are initialized by a supported way of structuring trials, e.g.,
:class:`TrialsFromBlock` for the first method described above. Internally, the
:class:`Trials` class will not convert this representation, but provide access
to data in specific trials (e.g., all spike trains in trial 5) or general
information about the trial structure (e.g., how many trials are there?) via a
fixed API. Trials are indexed consecutively starting from 0.

In the current implementation, classes :class:`TrialsFromBlock` and
:class:`TrialsFromLists` provide this unified way to access trial data.

        The number of analog signals in each trial.

    Examples
    --------
    1. Generate `TrialFromLists` object to handle data from three trials, each
       containing two spike trains and one analog signal.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import quantities as pq
    >>> import neo
    >>> from elephant.spike_train_generation import StationaryPoissonProcess
    >>> from elephant.trials import TrialsFromLists
    >>>
    >>> st_generator = StationaryPoissonProcess(rate=10*pq.Hz, t_stop=1*pq.s)
    >>> trial_list = [st_generator.generate_n_spiketrains(2) for _ in range(3)]
    >>> for trial in trial_list:
    >>>     signal = np.sin(np.arange(0, 6*np.pi, 2*np.pi/1000))
    >>>     signal += np.random.normal(size=signal.shape)
    >>>     trial.append(
    ...         neo.AnalogSignal(signal, units=pq.mV,
    ...                          t_stop=1*pq.s,
    ...                          sampling_rate=(1/3000)*pq.Hz)
    ...     )
    >>>
    >>> trials = TrialsFromLists(trial_list)

    2. Retrieve overall information.

    >>> print(trials.n_trials)
    3
    >>> print(trials.n_spiketrains_trial_by_trial)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> print(trials.n_analogsignals_trial_by_trial)
    [1, 1, 1]

    3. Access data in the first trial.

    >>> first_trial = trials[0]
    >>> first_spike_train = first_trial.spiketrains[0]
    >>> analog_signal = first_trial.analogsignals[0]
