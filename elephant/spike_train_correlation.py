def covariance(binned_spiketrain, binary=False, fast=True):
    r"""
    Calculate the NxN matrix of pairwise covariances between all combinations
    of N binned spike trains.

    For each pair of spike trains :math:`(i,j)`, the covariance :math:`C[i,j]`
    is obtained by binning :math:`i` and :math:`j` at the desired bin size. Let
    :math:`b_i` and :math:`b_j` denote the binned spike trains and
    :math:`\mu_i` and :math:`\mu_j` their respective averages. Then

    .. math::
         C[i,j] = <b_i-\mu_i, b_j-\mu_j> / (L-1)

    where `<., .>` is the scalar product of two vectors, and :math:`L` is the
    number of bins.

    For an input of N spike trains, an N x N matrix is returned containing the
    covariances for each combination of input spike trains.

    If binary is True, the binned spike trains are clipped to 0 or 1 before
    computing the covariance, so that the binned vectors :math:`b_i` and
    :math:`b_j` are binary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    binned_spiketrain : (N, ) elephant.conversion.BinnedSpikeTrain
        A binned spike train containing the spike trains to be evaluated.
    binary : bool, optional
        If True, the spikes of a particular spike train falling in the same bin
        are counted as 1, resulting in binary binned vectors :math:`b_i`. If
        False, the binned vectors :math:`b_i` contain the spike counts per bin.
        Default: False.
    fast : bool, optional
        If `fast=True` and the sparsity of `binned_spiketrain` is `> 0.1`, use
        `np.cov()`. Otherwise, use memory efficient implementation.
        See Notes [2].
        Default: True.

    Returns
    -------
    C : (N, N) np.ndarray
        The square matrix of covariances. The element :math:`C[i,j]=C[j,i]` is
        the covariance between `binned_spiketrain[i]` and

    Raises
    ------
    MemoryError

    Warns

    For an input of N spike trains, an N x N matrix is returned.
    Each entry in the matrix is a real number ranging between -1 (perfectly

    However, if k-th spike train is empty, k-th row and k-th column of the

    Computes the cross-correlation histogram (CCH) between two binned spike
    trains `binned_spiketrain_i` and `binned_spiketrain_j`.

    Visualization of this function is covered in Viziphant:
    :func:`viziphant.spike_train_correlation.plot_cross_correlation_histogram`.


    Parameters
    ----------
    binned_spiketrain_i, binned_spiketrain_j :
        elephant.conversion.BinnedSpikeTrain
        Binned spike trains of lengths N and M to cross-correlate. The input
        spike trains can have any `t_start` and `t_stop`.
    window : {'valid', 'full'} or list of int, optional
        ‘full’: This returns the cross-correlation at each point of overlap,
                with an output shape of (N+M-1,). At the end-points of the
                cross-correlogram, the signals do not overlap completely, and
                boundary effects may be seen.
        ‘valid’: Mode valid returns output of length max(M, N) - min(M, N) + 1.
                 The cross-correlation product is only given for points where
                 the signals overlap completely.
                 Values outside the signal boundary have no effect.
        List of integers (min_lag, max_lag):
              The entries of window are two integers representing the left and
              right extremes (expressed as number of bins) where the
              cross-correlation is computed.
        Default: 'full'.
    border_correction : bool, optional
        whether to correct for the border effect. If True, the value of the
        CCH at bin :math:`b` (for :math:`b=-H,-H+1, ...,H`, where :math:`H` is
        the CCH half-length) is multiplied by the correction factor:

        .. math::
                            (H+1)/(H+1-|b|),

        which linearly corrects for loss of bins at the edges.
        Default: False.
    binary : bool, optional
        If True, spikes falling in the same bin are counted as a single spike;
        otherwise they are counted as different spikes.
        Default: False.
    kernel : np.ndarray or None, optional
        A one dimensional array containing a smoothing kernel applied
        to the resulting CCH. The length N of the kernel indicates the
        smoothing window. The smoothing window cannot be larger than the
        maximum lag of the CCH. The kernel is normalized to unit area before
        being applied to the resulting CCH. Popular choices for the kernel are
          * normalized boxcar kernel: `numpy.ones(N)`
          * hamming: `numpy.hamming(N)`
          * hanning: `numpy.hanning(N)`
          * bartlett: `numpy.bartlett(N)`
        If None, the CCH is not smoothed.
        Default: None.
    method : {'speed', 'memory'}, optional
        Defines the algorithm to use. "speed" uses `numpy.correlate` to
        calculate the correlation between two binned spike trains using a
        non-sparse data representation. Due to various optimizations, it is the
        fastest realization. In contrast, the option "memory" uses an own
        implementation to calculate the correlation based on sparse matrices,
        which is more memory efficient but slower than the "speed" option.
        Default: "speed".
    cross_correlation_coefficient : bool, optional
        If True, a normalization is applied to the CCH to obtain the
        cross-correlation  coefficient function ranging from -1 to 1 according
        to Equation (5.10) in [1]_. See Notes.
        Default: False.

    Returns
    -------
    cch_result : neo.AnalogSignal
        Containing the cross-correlation histogram between
        `binned_spiketrain_i` and `binned_spiketrain_j`.

        Offset bins correspond to correlations at delays equivalent
        to the differences between the spike times of `binned_spiketrain_i` and
        those of `binned_spiketrain_j`: an entry at positive lag corresponds to
        a spike in `binned_spiketrain_j` following a spike in
        `binned_spiketrain_i` bins to the right, and an entry at negative lag
        corresponds to a spike in `binned_spiketrain_i` following a spike in
        `binned_spiketrain_j`.

        To illustrate this definition, consider two spike trains with the same
        `t_start` and `t_stop`:
        `binned_spiketrain_i` ('reference neuron') : 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
        `binned_spiketrain_j` ('target neuron')    : 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
        Here, the CCH will have an entry of `1` at `lag=+3`.

        Consistent with the definition of `neo.AnalogSignals`, the time axis
        represents the left bin borders of each histogram bin. For example,
        the time axis might be:
        `np.array([-2.5 -1.5 -0.5 0.5 1.5]) * ms`
    lags : np.ndarray
        Contains the IDs of the individual histogram bins, where the central
        bin has ID 0, bins to the left have negative IDs and bins to the right
        have positive IDs, e.g.,:
        `np.array([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3])`

    Notes
    -----
    1. The Eq. (5.10) in [1]_ is valid for binned spike trains with at most one
       spike per bin. For a general case, refer to the implementation of
       `_covariance_sparse()`.
    2. Alias: `cch`

    """
    Calculates the Spike Time Tiling Coefficient (STTC) as described in [1]_
    following their implementation in C.
    The STTC is a pairwise measure of correlation between spike trains.
    It has been proposed as a replacement for the correlation index as it
    presents several advantages (e.g. it's not confounded by firing rate,
    appropriately distinguishes lack of correlation from anti-correlation,
    periods of silence don't add to the correlation and it's sensitive to
    firing patterns).

    The STTC is calculated as follows:

    .. math::
        STTC = 1/2((PA - TB)/(1 - PA*TB) + (PB - TA)/(1 - PB*TA))

    Where `PA` is the proportion of spikes from train 1 that lie within
    `[-dt, +dt]` of any spike of train 2 divided by the total number of spikes
    in train 1, `PB` is the same proportion for the spikes in train 2;
    `TA` is the proportion of total recording time within `[-dt, +dt]` of any
    spike in train 1, TB is the same proportion for train 2.
    For :math:`TA = PB = 1`and for :math:`TB = PA = 1`
    the resulting :math:`0/0` is replaced with :math:`1`,
    since every spike from the train with :math:`T = 1` is within
    `[-dt, +dt]` of a spike of the other train.

    This is a Python implementation compatible with the elephant library of
    the original code by C. Cutts written in C and avaiable at:
    (https://github.com/CCutts/Detecting_pairwise_correlations_in_spike_trains/
    blob/master/spike_time_tiling_coefficient.c)

    Parameters
    ----------
    spiketrain_i, spiketrain_j: neo.SpikeTrain
        Spike trains to cross-correlate. They must have the same `t_start` and
        `t_stop`.
    dt: pq.Quantity.
        The synchronicity window is used for both: the quantification of the
        proportion of total recording time that lies `[-dt, +dt]` of each spike
        in each train and the proportion of spikes in `spiketrain_i` that lies
        `[-dt, +dt]` of any spike in `spiketrain_j`.
        Default : `0.005 * pq.s`

    Returns
    -------
    index:  float or np.nan
        The spike time tiling coefficient (STTC). Returns np.nan if any spike
        train is empty.

def spike_train_timescale(binned_spiketrain, max_tau):
    r"""
    Calculates the auto-correlation time of a binned spike train.
    Uses the definition of the auto-correlation time proposed in [[1]_,
    Eq. (6)]:

    .. math::
        \tau_\mathrm{corr} = \int_{-\tau_\mathrm{max}}^{\tau_\mathrm{max}}\
            \left[ \frac{\hat{C}(\tau)}{\hat{C}(0)} \right]^2 d\tau

    where :math:`\hat{C}(\tau) = C(\tau)-\nu\delta(\tau)` denotes
    the auto-correlation function excluding the Dirac delta at zero timelag.

    Parameters
    ----------
    binned_spiketrain : elephant.conversion.BinnedSpikeTrain
        A binned spike train containing the spike train to be evaluated.
    max_tau : pq.Quantity
        Maximal integration time :math:`\tau_{max}` of the auto-correlation
        function. It needs to be a multiple of the `bin_size` of
        `binned_spiketrain`.

    Returns
    -------
    timescale : pq.Quantity
        The auto-correlation time of the binned spiketrain with the same units
        as in the input. If `binned_spiketrain` has less than 2 spikes, a
        warning is raised and `np.nan` is returned.

    Notes
    -----
    * :math:`\tau_\mathrm{max}` is a critical parameter: numerical estimates
      of the auto-correlation functions are inherently noisy. Due to the
      square in the definition above, this noise is integrated. Thus, it is
      necessary to introduce a cutoff for the numerical integration - this
      cutoff should be neither smaller than the true auto-correlation time
      nor much bigger.
    * The bin size of `binned_spiketrain` is another critical parameter as it
      defines the discretization of the integral :math:`d\tau`. If it is too
      big, the numerical approximation of the integral is inaccurate.
