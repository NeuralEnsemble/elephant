These tutorials provide narrative explanations, sample code, and expected
output for some of the neurophysiological analyses in Elephant. You can browse
the tutorials or launch them in mybinder to change and interact with the code.


Introductory
------------

* Statistics of spike trains.

  Covers ``statistics`` module with an introduction to
  `Neo <https://neo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ input-output data types like
  `SpikeTrain`, `AnalogSignal`, etc.

Advanced
--------

* Unitary Event Analysis.

  The analysis detects coordinated spiking activity that occurs significantly
  more often than predicted by the firing rates of neurons alone. It's superior
  to simple statistics.

* Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA).

  GPFA is a dimensionality reduction method for neural trajectory visualization
  of parallel spike trains.
